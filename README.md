## Catbot Setup

Setup scripts for cat-bots (cathook navbots)
For more information, visit [Cathook](https://github.com/nullworks/cathook/)

After the install script finished successfully, navmesh files have to be moved into your tf2 maps directory.  
They can be found [here](https://github.com/nullworks/catbot-database).

Due to steam recently adding Recaptcha v2, you must provide accounts to the account-generator. More information in [this](https://t.me/sag_bot) Channel.
